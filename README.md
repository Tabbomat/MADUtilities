# MADUtilities

This is a collection of scripts used to manage [MAD](https://github.com/Map-A-Droid/MAD).

## ortools_route.py

This script interactively recalculates your routes using [OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization).
OR-Tools requires 64 bit python. If your MAD installation runs on a 32 bit server (for example Raspberry Pi), you can run this script on a 64 bit machine to optimize your routes.
